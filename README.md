# Portfolio

## Your Task

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

Your task is to create a portfolio using your new React skills, which will help set you apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies.

You’ll deploy this application to Netlify. Follow the instructions in the Git Guide or consult the [Docs on Netlify](https://vitejs.dev/guide/static-deploy.html#netlify) to create a build that you can deploy.

## User Story

```md
As a fresh graduate of the bootcamp I am trying to showcase the skills i have learnt by
building a single-page application. This is a deployed React Portfolio of work samples
so that I can show off some of the work I have done during my course and consider me for
an open position
```

## Description

```md
This is a single-page application portfolio for a web developer and when I load the portfolio I am presented with a page containing a header, a section for content, and a footer. WhenN I click on a navigation title the browser URL changes and I am presented with the corresponding section below the navigation and that title is highlighted. When I load the portfolio the first time the Home title and section are selected by default.
WHEN I am presented with the About Me section. When I am presented with the Projects section I see titled images of the developer’s applications with links to both the deployed applications and the corresponding GitHub repositories. When I am presented with the Contact section I see a contact form with fields for a name, an email address, and a message. When I view the footer I am presented with text links to the developer’s GitHub and LinkedIn profiles, and their profile.
